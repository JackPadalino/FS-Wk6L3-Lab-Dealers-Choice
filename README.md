# Repo for Fullstack Junior Phase week 6 lesson 3 lab: Dealer's choice
In this module, we will continue to expand on your PostgreSQL knowledge by adding Sequelize, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that will act as a data layer in our application.

At this point you should be familiar with setting up your database and models, as well seeding a database. What we will be doing now is creating associations for your models (for example, an Author can have many Books, and a Book can belong to an Author), which will in turn give us greater querying abilities.

You can choose any subject you would like to model for this exercise. This is an opportunity to get creative! The only requirement is that you must have at least two models and at least one belongs to association on one of your models. But you may create more models and associations for more practice.

At the end of this module you should have a database with models and associations between those models, and also an Express route that returns JSON data.
